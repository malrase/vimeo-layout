This repo is about two and a half hours' worth of work.

What I have done so far:
- Used Sass and a BEM-style naming convention for styling elements
- The first section is complete
- The second section isn't quite there in terms of functionality

Things I would do next:
- Add the interactivity to the carousel
  - I played around with writing one myself, but without more information around constraints (e.g. is there a set number of items in the carousel? etc.), I'm not sure the best way to develop it. I would probably use a pre-made carousel over a handmade one.
- Improve the responsivity of the carousel
