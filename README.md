This repo is about two hours' worth of work.

What I have done so far:
- Used Sass and a BEM-style naming convention for styling elements
- The first section is complete
- The second section isn't quite there (see below)

Things I would do next:
- Add the interactivity to the carousel
- Improve the responsivity of the carousel
  - (currently the poster decreases in width)
